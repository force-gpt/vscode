# ForceGPT (Beta) - Your Salesforce Specialized Code Assistant

ForceGPT is an assistant and high quality code generator specialized in Salesforce Core platform, taking advantage of the latest GPT models' capabilities. It will help you create, improve, and even fix your code, making your Salesforce development journey smoother and more efficient. We already support working with Apex and Lightning Web Components, ahead of any other solution we know of (even Salesforce's).

If you are tired of waiting for Salesforce official Einstein for Developers, wait no longer. This extension is available now and goes further, striving always to provide a complementary or simply better approach.

**Developed by Salesforce Experts:** Our team of Salesforce technology experts has created ForceGPT to ensure it aligns perfectly with the platform's best practices, complexities, and nuances. It's not just another generic code generation tool â€“ it's your Salesforce coding companion. Thus, it understands Salesforce metadata, elements composed of several files like Lightning Web Components, security keywords, and more.
