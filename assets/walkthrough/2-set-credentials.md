If you already have your ForceGPT account set and ready, create an **API key** in the web [Dashboard's Integration tab](https://app.force-gpt.com/dashboard?section=integration). You can name it "VS Code Extension" or anything you want.

You can also create multiple API keys if you want to control access from multiple environments individually.

With your **username and API key**, go and execute the **Set credentials** command.
