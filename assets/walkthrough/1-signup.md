<h1>Welcome to the ForceGPT extension</h1>

<h3>We are so excited to have you here!</h3>

Get ready to change the way you code for *Salesforce* ðŸ¤–ðŸ’»ðŸš€

First off, you need a **ForceGPT account** to get an **API key**. To sign up, just use the **Signup** command button.

Once you have signed up, **your username and a new API key are automatically stored** in the extension, so you can **skip the following "Set credentials" step**. Remember that the username may need to be enabled, so the credentials will not be valid until you receive the activation email.

If you already have a ForceGPT account, then go to the "Set Credentials" step. Or if you prefer, signup directly at [ForceGPT](https://app.force-gpt.com/signup).
