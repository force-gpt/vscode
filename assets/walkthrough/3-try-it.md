<h3>And that's all you need for this setup! ðŸŽ‰</h3>

Want to try the extension? You can create a new Apex class (test included!) by just giving ForceGPT a human description.

You may try with some of these, or any other you want!

>```A classic "Hello World" exmaple.```

<p></p>

>```I need a utils class with a method to get the picklist labels for a given object and field, and another method to get a org-wide email address id given the email.```

<p></p>

>```Include a method to invoke https://app.force-gpt.com/assistant/generate/apex-class endpoint to get an Apex class to be stored in a Document. The class definition will come from a "request" function parameter, to be set in the body's "request" attribute. The response will come in a "content" attribute with "name" and "code" sub-attributes.```
